Hi, I am Kararou Ren!  My name is often stylized as Ræn and pronounced as rain,
like the weather!

I am a transfemme hacker.  My prounouns are [fæ/fær](https://pronoun.is/fae).

My specialty is information security.  I can be both blue and red team.  I am
(not very) versed in the realm of software engineering, but also have some
experience with hardware hacking, design, and layout.

The programming languages I've worked with the most are C, Go, Rust, and
Python.  In no particular order, but I happen to really like Rust and C.

I have OS experience with [Illumos](https://illumos.org/),
[SmartOS](https://wiki.smartos.org/), [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/),
[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/), [Debain](https://www.debian.org/), [Arch
Linux](https://archlinux.org/), [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/), [Linux From
Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/), [Minix](https://www.minix3.org/),
[Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/), and
[Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).

I have blue team experience with the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/),
[Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/), [LogRhythm](https://logrhythm.com/), [Cisco
ASA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/adaptive-security-appliance-asa-software/index.html),
[FortiGate](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall), and
