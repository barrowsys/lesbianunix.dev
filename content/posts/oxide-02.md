Alright, lets go through these materials together.  Looking them over, there's
actually a lot of content to build here.  For those of you following along at
home, you can find a copy of the materials
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xtofg-fMQfZoq8Y3oSAKjEgDQCRHx-GMSmPcxdEea4A/edit).

My rules here for myself are simple.  I'm going to go through this document one
paragraph at a time.  I will not be skipping ahead.  I realize that this is
probably a bad way to complete this document, but should I really dwell on this
decision, or should I just have fun doing it?

That's what I thought!  Lets start at the top, the opening.

```
Thank you for your interest in Oxide!

At Oxide, we are taking a big swing: rethinking the definition of the
server-side computer, combining the wisdom of hyperscaler systems with the
energy of the open data center -- and delivering it as a product.
```

Easy opening.  These lovely folks have given us a beautiful short and easy
summary of what they are doing.  For those who don't really know computers that
well, they are basically building computers in a new way.

The closest kinds of computers that their new servers will resemble are the
hyperscaler's systems.  One full rack that is completely integrated, from
hardware up to the software.  And that's really cool.

Their goal is to make the same kind of technology available to Google,
Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc. available to all.  That is laudible and
wonderful.

```
We are looking for engineers who share our mission.

Our most deeply held engineering belief is in the integration of hardware and
software: we believe that the best and most reliable infrastructure comes when
hardware and software are designed to work with one another. We are looking
for technologists who share this worldview: hardware engineers with a sympathy
for software and software engineers with an understanding of hardware.  If it
needs to be said, this isn’t easy!
```

Software as a reflection of hardware.  Hardware as a reflection of software.

This is so hard to explain.  Most people don't have experience running software
thats built specifically for the hardware they are using.  *I don't even have
this experience*.  But they aren't just referring here to using software built
for your specific hardware.  What they are referring to is something deeper.
Something far harder to come by.

At the core of this, the entire hardware stack is integrated.  The networking
gear, the storage gear, the compute gear, the whole stack, from bottom to top.
Everything that the hardware is.  Integration.  But there's slightly more here,
too.

Hardware doesn't run in a vacuum.  Some people believe that software is a rigid
category -- only specific things are software.  Things like programs written to
run on an operating system.  But you can broaden your idea of what software is.
From a certain point of view, software can be as simple as the written word.

But if software is written word, ideas put to paper, what happens when you put
your logic and ideas down in silicon, or on the PCB in the form of components?
Clearly it doesn't represent software as we've come to colloqualize it, but it
is.  Yes, this is deeply philisophical.  But what I'm trying to get at is that
the hardware and the software are really the same thing.

From what I've gathered, listening to [Bryan
Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and [Adam
Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl) in their [Twitter
Spaces](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/twitter-spaces) is that they believe
software and hardware represent the same class of the machinery of thought.
Honestly, I probably have this wrong.  And maybe I'm ascribing my own beliefs
to things that closely resemble, but aren't quite the same.  Maybe I aught to
ask them one day how close I am.

``` 
We are looking for engineers who like to solve hard problems.

At Oxide, our values are deeply important to us — so much so that we make them
explicit and refer to them frequently:
 
Candor Diversity Optimism Rigor
Transparency Courage Empathy Resilience
Teamwork Urgency Curiosity Humor
Responsibility Thriftiness Versatility

```

It is at this point that I realize this is going to be a very long post.  I
could do an entire essay on values.  Actually, now that I think of it, I *have*
written entire essays on the importance of values, admittedly only at the
highschool level.  Perhaps a good look at this is Bryan's 2017 talk [Platform
as a Reflection of Values](https://vimeo.com/230142234) is a good place to
start.

gets saved.  Making sure draft mode remains is super important.)
