Alright, lets go through these materials together.  Looking them over, there's
actually a lot of content to build here.  For those of you following along at
home, you can find a copy of the materials
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xtofg-fMQfZoq8Y3oSAKjEgDQCRHx-GMSmPcxdEea4A/edit).

My rules here for myself are simple.  I'm going to go through this document one
paragraph at a time.  I will not be skipping ahead.  I realize that this is
probably a bad way to complete this document, but should I really dwell on this
decision, or should I just have fun doing it?

That's what I thought!  Lets start at the top, the opening.

```
Thank you for your interest in Oxide!

At Oxide, we are taking a big swing: rethinking the definition of the
server-side computer, combining the wisdom of hyperscaler systems with the
energy of the open data center -- and delivering it as a product.

We are looking for engineers who share our mission.
```

Easy opening.  These lovely folks have given us a beautiful short and easy
summary of what they are doing.  For those who don't really know computers that
well, they are basically building computers in a new way.

The closest kinds of computers that their new servers will resemble are the
hyperscaler's systems.  One full rack that is completely integrated, from
hardware up to the software.  And that's really cool.

Their goal is to make the same kind of technology available to Google,
Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc. available to all.  That is laudible and
wonderful.

```
Our most deeply held engineering belief is in the integration of hardware and
software: we believe that the best and most reliable infrastructure comes when
hardware and software are designed to work with one another. We are looking
for technologists who share this worldview: hardware engineers with a sympathy
for software and software engineers with an understanding of hardware.  If it
needs to be said, this isn’t easy!

We are looking for engineers who like to solve hard problems.
```

Software as a reflection of hardware.  Hardware as a reflection of software.

This is so hard to explain.  Most people don't have experience running software
thats built specifically for the hardware they are using.  *I don't even have
this experience*.  But they aren't just referring here to using software built
for your specific hardware.  What they are referring to is something deeper.
Something far harder to come by.

At the core of this, the entire hardware stack is integrated.  The networking
gear, the storage gear, the compute gear, the whole stack, from bottom to top.
Everything that the hardware is.  Integration.  But there's slightly more here,
too.

Hardware doesn't run in a vacuum.  Some people believe that software is a rigid
category -- only specific things are software.  Things like programs written to
run on an operating system.  But you can broaden your idea of what software is.
From a certain point of view, software can be as simple as the written word.

But if software is written word, ideas put to paper, what happens when you put
your logic and ideas down in silicon, or on the PCB in the form of components?
Clearly it doesn't represent software as we've come to colloqualize it, but it
is.  Yes, this is deeply philisophical.  But what I'm trying to get at is that
the hardware and the software are really the same thing.

From what I've gathered, listening to [Bryan
Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) and [Adam
Leventhal](https://twitter.com/ahl) (among many others) in their [Twitter
Spaces](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/twitter-spaces) is that they believe
software and hardware represent the same class of the machinery of thought.
Honestly, I probably have this wrong.  And maybe I'm ascribing my own beliefs
to things that closely resemble, but aren't quite the same.  Maybe I aught to
ask them one day how close I am.

``` 
At Oxide, our values are deeply important to us — so much so that we make them
explicit and refer to them frequently:
 
Candor Diversity Optimism Rigor
Transparency Courage Empathy Resilience
Teamwork Urgency Curiosity Humor
Responsibility Thriftiness Versatility

We are looking for engineers who share our values.
```

It is at this point that I realize this is going to be a very long post.  I
could do an entire essay on values.  Actually, now that I think of it, I *have*
written entire essays on the importance of values, admittedly only at the
highschool level.  Perhaps a good look at Bryan's 2017 talk [Platform as a
Reflection of Values](https://vimeo.com/230142234) is a good place to start.

I'm not going to go in to depth with all of these values, that would take quite
a bit more blog space than I'm willing to give. But I'm going to pick two that
I really resonate with: `transparency` and `teamwork`.

In all things, there is nothing more important than transparency.  Being as
open and honest as you can is how the seedlings of all relationships are built.
Without transparency, trust cannot exist.  And there is nothing without trust.
This is important from the most basic relationships between to people, all the
way up to the relationships between people and governments.  Without
transparency, any relationship can be clouded in doubt and trust can be eroded
away.

None of this is in contradiction to privacy, mind you, everyone has their
boundaries and its important to be transparent about where those lines are.

Teamwork is additionally important to me.  While working alone is fine, I much
better enjoy my work if I can share it with others.  From the time when I was
slinging coffee to now, while working IT, there is a certain joy in
collaboration that is irreplaceable.  Solving a problem with a team that has a
diverse background is like the joy of learning put into a new, completely
amazing, context.

Working with people always brings to light new ideas and solutions, or caveats
to ideas.  Working alone never brings about these insights.  In my solo
projects, I've never had the same insights as when I was working with people.

I believe in the power of human connection.

```
Our hiring process is a little different than most:  we believe that the
best basis for assessment of an engineer is not through their performance on an
arbitrary oral exam, but rather through their own expression.  That is, we
choose to use interviews not to assess you as a stranger, but rather to more
deeply understand the complete engineer who your work indicates you to be.

You should find that these candidate materials will take no more than a couple
of hours to gather; please make a copy of this document and for each section,
please use the space provided, expanding into additional pages as necessary.
When completed, please export this document as a PDF and submit it with your
application.
```

This is simply an explanation of what this document really is, which wraps up
the preamble.  But before I'm done here, I do want to mention a few things on
this.  Within a lot of communities, there's a certain distaste for the cover
letter.  And while this is *technically* a cover letter, its also a lot more
than that.  These materials are an attempt to get to understand an engineer on
a deeper level than what the typical application does.  To be honest I like
that.
