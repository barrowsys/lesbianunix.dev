Hi!  I'm alive.  Sounds weird to say, but I am.  I just lauched a gemini mirror
of this site, too!  Visit it at gemini://lesbianunix.dev.  I hope you enjoy
reading it as much as I enjoyed building it.   Look, if you really need proof
that I'm alive, you can run a verify on the commit that contains this post.
You can get a copy of my GPG key [here](https://lesbianunix.dev/ren.asc) (also
available over [gemini](gemini://lesbianunix.dev/ren.asc)), and verify the
commit yourself.

Don't worry, nobody else has access to my key.  Its *mine*.

I host the site code on [github](https://github.com/karaiwulf/lesbianunix.dev)
as a primary, but I also have a mirror on [my git
server](https://git.kararou.space/karaiwulf/lesbianunix.dev), and a mirror of
the mirror on the [cybre.tech git
server](https://cybre.tech/karaiwulf/lesbianunix.dev).

P.S. I'm on matrix (@spicywolf:matrix.kararou.space), Mastodon
(@spicywolf@cybre.space) and you can always reach me via
[email](mailto:ren@kararou.space) (please sign/encrypt all messages!).
