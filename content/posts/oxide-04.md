Oh for the love of whatever gods may exist.  All of my writing is here.  Or in
the knoledge management system at work.  Its really not that technical at all.
This feels far more doomed than I thought.

As I said in my last post, I'm really not that much of a developer.  I can do
documentation fine, even if its a bit lackluster, but I do appreciate code with
documentation in the sources.  And I even further enjoy code with well written
documentation in the sources.  I strive for this, but I haven't had the chance
or opportunity to pull my own projects from anything more than simple proof of
concepts with little documentation.

If I'm honest, going through these is starting to make me feel like I'm
ill-equipped to be even close to Oxide standards.  And that's okay, but its
pointing out what I'm missing in terms of my engineering prowess.  I've got a
long road ahead of me in terms of learning and... honestly just making cool
shit.

# Writing Samples

```
We have found that the engineers that we like to work with tend to value the
written word. Whatâ€™s an example of writing that you are proud of?  This writing
can take a variety of forms, e.g.:

 * A block comment in source code
 * A blog entry or other long-form post on a technical issue
 * A technical: 
   * architecture document
   * design document
   * specification
   * whitepaper
   * academic paper

Please submit at least one writing sample (and no more than three) that you
feel represents you, providing links if/as necessary.
```

Truth be told, the most technical piece of writing on this site has got to be
either the [Triton Backups](/posts/triton-backups/) or [Accidental Deletion of
CMON](/posts/delete/) - and those are both short, and rather bad at being
documentation.

I'm additionally working on getting my two best articles from the knowledge
management system at work sanitized and in a state of deliverable.  They are
about disk paritioning using `parted`.  I'll update this article when I have
them in hand, but for now... You just get to live with the above.

UPDATE: My boss approved the use of these KB articles: [Working with a Blank
Drive in
Linux](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T-1EcYnGRUzCfd3qNYEXiWdH8MR7zzETysw1RztaGwo/edit?usp=sharing),
and [Working with an Already Partitioned Drive in
Linux](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aPSxmrL6_xyeA3Q2Nd0JKh0239V-U1ZQ0dqK16g3ho/edit?usp=sharing).
