Keyboards Keyboards Keyboards.  Supposedly its a part of the transfemme
stereotype to like mechanical keyboards.  Maybe that's because we are vastly
over-represented in fields where having a nice keyboard matters.  Maybe not.

Regardless of that, my second mechanical keyboard ever, the [Das Keyboard 4
Ultimate](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-ultimate/), has been
falling out of usage lately because its keycaps were a bit out of sorts (read:
falling apart).

I got a set of [DSA profile PBT
keycaps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JB8BTHV) to build a left-handed
keyboard (having become a mother, working from home, and working pretty much
all the time, left me holding my kiddo a lot and struggling to type).  The
project never came to fruition due to a child suddenly taking all of my free
time (it was very welcomed, though, and the performance hit was really
minimal).

So I pulled the Das Keyboard apart, gave it a thurough isopropyl alcohol
scrubbing everywhere (cheap toothbrushes are *always* nice to have around),
gave it a nice pink paint job, and purchased a set of [plate-mounted
stabilizers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K8FFDYJ) to affix the new
keycaps.

I didn't think to stop and take pictures while I had the bezel and keybed
removed, but I need to redo the paint job on the bezel, as it didn't cure all
the way before I put the keyboard back together, causing small bubbles and
ripples, so stay tuned for a proper teardown of the whole keyboard, including a
look at the board itself (its got a fancy Via semiconductors chip that offers a
3-port USB 3.0 hub on a chip).
