# Hello, World!

I decided to pull lesbianunix.dev because of a silly meme, but I've decided I
quite like the domain a lot.  For those of you who don't know, I'm Kararou Ren,
also [@karaiwulf](https://twitter.com/karaiwulf) on Twitter.  I'm a transfemme,
lesbian as hell computer nerd.  I do lots of things, but one of my passions is
UNIX development.  Not just development in the application side, but also in
the operating system side itself.  In fact, this very site is run using an
OpenSolaris variant called [Illumos](https://illumos.org).  I've been mostly
playing around with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) lately, but I'm versed in C,
C++, and Python.  I only know enough assembly to make things boot, which is
surprisingly, not a lot.
